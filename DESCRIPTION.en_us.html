<p>Alata is an original typeface designed by <a href="https://www.2xux.com/">Spyros Zevelakis.</a></p>

<p>Alata is a geometric low contrast sans typeface that can feel monumental, serious and archaic and occsionally eccentric. It draws inspiration from both Early 20th C poster lettering and epigraphic Greek mono line letters. Curiously the capitals letters draw influence from UK Lettering while in contrast the lower case is more continetal european in character. Alata offers a wide range of figures including Oldstyle figures, small numbers including superiors and fractions. Alata also offers case sensitive forms.</p>
